This is the first project for The Odin Project.

The goal is to create a simple recipe website, without focusing on making it pretty.

Skills I learned/reinforced:
  - write Boilerplate from memory
  - structure site with a hierarchy
  - set up a structured directory
  - use relative links
  - use "<strong>" for better readability
  - use images, with "alt" attribute
  - use unordered and ordered lists
  - use "atomic commits"
  - get familiar with git and github
