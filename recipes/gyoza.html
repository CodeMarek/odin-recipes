    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gyoza is a type of <strong>Japanese dumplings</strong>, with juicy meat filling inside of dumpling wrappers.Originating from Chinese jiaozi dumplings, they have become a mainstay of Japanese recipes. It's very popular in and outside of Japan.</p>

    <p>In the United States, you can find them at Japanese restaurants and Asian-themed restaurants. They are often served as an <strong>appetizer</strong>, or part of a combo meal or in a bento box. For an extra burst of umami, consider adding a shoyu egg alongside your gyoza.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Gyoza wrapper, store-bought</li>
      <li>Oil</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Ground pork</li>
      <li>Cabbage</li>
      <li>Ginger</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Soy Sauce</li>
      <li>Sake</li>
      <li>White Pepper</li>
      <li>Sesame oil</li>
      <li>Chopped Scallion</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Japanese Ponzu</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a bowl, combine all the ingredients in the Filling and blend well. The Filling should be <strong>sticky and cohesive</strong>.</li>
      <li>To make Gyoza Sauce, combine the <strong>Ponzu</strong> with the <strong>sesame oil</strong> in a small dipping bowl. Stir to blend well.</li>
      <li>To assemble the gyoza, place a piece of the gyoza wrapper on your <strong>palm or a flat surface</strong>. Spoon about <strong>1 teaspoon</strong> of the filling onto the center of the wrapper. Dip your index finger into some water and moisten the outer edges of the dumpling wrapper.</li>
      <li><strong>Fold the gyoza over, press, and seal the left end</strong>. Use your thumb and index finger to create pleats and pinch to secure tightly. Repeat the process to form more pleats (start with 3-4 pleats if you're a beginner). A nicely wrapped gyoza should have a <strong>crescent</strong> shape.</li>
      <li>Heat the oil in a skillet or stir-fry pan over <strong>medium heat</strong>. Arrange the gyoza in the pan and cover with a lid. Pan-fry the gyoza until the bottoms turn <strong>golden brown and crispy</strong>.</li>
      <li>Add about <strong>1/4 inch of water</strong> to the skillet or stir-fry pan and cover with the lid <strong>immediately</strong>. The water should evaporate after a few minutes. Continue to cook the gyoza for a couple more minutes to <strong>crisp up the bottoms</strong>. Remove the gyoza from the skillet or stir-fry pan and serve immediately with the gyoza sauce.</li>
    </ol>
